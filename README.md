**DriveSmart Lead Workflow Overview**
This flow represents how sales and operations teams interact with the DriveSmart dashboard:

Lead Listing Page is the main entry point, where users filter, view, and manage leads.

From there, clicking a lead opens the Lead Details View, enabling status updates, communication, and note-taking.

When a lead is marked as Converted or Lost, the system transitions to the Analytics Dashboard, where performance metrics, charts, and heatmaps are shown.

Bulk actions from the listing page (like assigning leads) take users to the Lead Management Panel, where they can upload data, set rules, and track agent performance.

All sections loop back to the listing page to ensure seamless navigation and follow-up.
